          Let me first introduce myself
        </h1>
        <p>
          My name is Erna Goudt. I studied Geography in Amsterdam, where I have lived all my live. I love to travel, as far and for as long as I can and while doing so explore other cultures and meet new people. I am currently in the process of becoming a kick-ass web-developer. Why? I believe that technology can change the world for the better. Not only in the sense that we are now able to switch on the light without the touch of a button. But also in the larger sense. With the right technological solutions we will be able to lift people out of poverty, combat climate change and much more. Learning to code will hopefully make me able to contribute to these life changing technologies.
